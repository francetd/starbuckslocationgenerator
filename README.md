# Starbucks Location Generator

The purpose of this generator was to create a GUI that would ask a user for information on their specific location that they would like to search up and match them with nearby Starbucks store locations.   

## Description

I was tasked an end of the year project in my 'Introduction to Programming' class to create a GUI that would address a real-world problem, and perform a read on an external data set to perform a given analysis. In my case, I utilized a kaggle data set on Worldwide Starbucks Locations to help a user find a specific starbucks location nearby to whatever area they are looking for. Additionally, I wanted the user to rate the system as 'feedback' for the generator through the 'Rate Generator' button and drop down menu. The "Find Nearby Locations" was for initial users who wanted to look for a nearby Starbucks location from their inputted information. It would give all the extra information including if the shop was soley Tevana or Starbucks and the time zone within a file (found_data.csv). Additionally, the "Simplify Location Informations" button would reduce any extra unneeded information that the user may not want included in a seperate file (simplified_locations.csv). Finally, I included both an "Exit" button and a "Directions" button that would include directions to using the generator. I  also utilized pop up windows for errors and messages for the users to see when performing an action.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

* Either  Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux


### Installing

* Download an IDE (I used Thonny) for the function to be used. 


### Executing program

1. To start first make sure that all files included in this repository are completely downloaded to your own computer. 
2. Files downloaded within your computer should be within the same path directory for this to work. 
3. Directions should appear within the "Directions" button on the GUI.  

## Help

Directions should guide you into any sort of help needed. There are a couple of bugs (example: some user errors in inputting a wrong number, word, or letter is not accounted for) when plugging into the system that I unfortunately did not have time to change. Nonetheless, I plan on fixing these issues with a new version later. 

* If the code is not fully functional please let me know ASAP


## Version History

* 0.1
    * Initial Release
    * Bugs in some user inputs
    * Would include constructing a functional rating report  that would send user inputs into another csv file for analysis
